## Why Clearnet Market?

Crypto has risen over the years to give the people financial freedom from larger powers beyond our control.  Banks, Paypal, and Credit Cards have long reigned king of the internet for payments. They have held 'our' money hostage at there own profit.  The people need a market where the poorest can sell there goods without high fees or the need to meet standards avaiable in only rich countries. A market where disputes are settled by a fellow unbiased individual and not corporate procedures predetermined. A market where the coin in there wallet is there coin.  From these thoughts Clearnet Market has become a passion to provide the people the financial freedom they need.
